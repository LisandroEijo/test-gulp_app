## Gulp Test App
This is a very litle static project to text gulp. I'd follow https://css-tricks.com/gulp-for-beginners/

There is two main task, one that that watch for scss files and compile to css. 
This one also look for changes in html and js, and refresh the browser, and is call _"watch"_.

The other one is make a dist/ folder with all the files, compiled and minified, and compress the images. this is call _"build"_
